To execute the sequential implementation run:

```

./sequential [n] [d] [k]
```

where the arguments [n] [d] and [k] represent the number of points, the dimension of the points
and the number of nearest neighbours to search for.

To execute the parallel implementation run

```
make parallel
./parallel [n] [d] [k]
```
